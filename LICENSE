## Frequently Asked Questions

No. Nonprofits, civic tech organizations, academic institutions, and government agencies can use Hakivo under the AGPL-3.0 license free of charge.

### What if I want to contribute improvements back to Hakivo?
Contributions are welcome! If you contribute code, you agree to license those contributions under both AGPL-3.0 (for the open source project) and grant us the right to relicense them commercially. This enables dual licensing to continue.

License terms are renegotiated upon significant changes in company size, revenue, or use case. We work with you to ensure fair pricing.

### Do you offer source code escrow?
Yes, source code escrow arrangements are available for Enterprise customers.
