# Introducing Hakivo Studio: Transform Legislative Data into Professional Documents

We're excited to announce **Hakivo Studio**, a powerful new feature that transforms your legislative tracking data into polished, professional documents with just a few clicks. Whether you need a policy brief, executive summary, or stakeholder presentation, Studio has you covered.

## What is Hakivo Studio?

Hakivo Studio is a document generation tool that combines your legislative data with real-time enrichment and AI-powered formatting. It takes the bills, briefs, and policy information you're already tracking in Hakivo and transforms them into beautifully designed documents you can share, present, or archive.

The feature is currently **in alpha** and available to all Hakivo users for free. Once Studio exits alpha, it will become an exclusive feature for paid subscribers.

## How It Works

Studio follows a simple four-step workflow:

### 1. Choose a Template

Select from a variety of professionally designed templates tailored for different use cases:

- **Policy Briefs** - Concise summaries for decision-makers
- **Executive Summaries** - High-level overviews for leadership
- **Stakeholder Presentations** - Visual presentations for meetings
- **Legislative Analysis** - Deep dives into specific bills
- **Advocacy Materials** - Content designed to drive action

Each template is optimized for its intended audience, with appropriate tone, length, and formatting.

### 2. Select Your Data Source

Choose the content you want to transform:

- **Your Daily Briefs** - Turn your personalized briefings into shareable documents
- **Tracked Bills** - Create focused reports on legislation you're following
- **Bill Search** - Find and document any federal bill
- **Custom Content** - Enter your own text to enhance

### 3. Enrich Your Content

This is where Studio truly shines. Add real-time context and data to your document:

- **News Context** - Recent news coverage powered by Perplexity's AI search
- **Related Bills** - Automatically discover and include related legislation
- **Campaign Finance** - Add relevant political contribution data
- **Voting Records** - Include historical voting patterns
- **Bill Details** - Full legislative text, sponsors, and status

### 4. Generate and Download

Preview your enriched content, then generate your final document. Within seconds, you'll have a professional document ready to:

- View and edit in your browser
- Download as PDF
- Export as PowerPoint (PPTX)
- Share via link

## Powered by Gamma

Under the hood, Hakivo Studio is powered by [Gamma](https://gamma.app), a cutting-edge AI presentation and document platform. For those unfamiliar, Gamma is a next-generation tool that uses AI to create visually stunning presentations, documents, and web pages.

- **Creates responsive layouts** - Documents look great on any device
- **Offers one-click formatting** - Professional design without the learning curve
- **Supports multiple export formats** - PDF, PPTX, and web sharing

By integrating Gamma's API, Hakivo Studio delivers the same professional quality you'd get from hours of manual design work, but in seconds.
