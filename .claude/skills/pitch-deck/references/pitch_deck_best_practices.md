# Pitch Deck Best Practices

This reference guide provides best practices for creating effective pitch decks for startups and business pitches.

## General Principles

### Keep It Concise
- **10-15 slides maximum**: Investors have limited attention spans
- **One key message per slide**: Don't overcrowd slides with information
- **Use visuals**: Images, charts, and diagrams are more impactful than text

### Tell a Story
- Create a narrative arc: Problem → Solution → Opportunity → Why Us
- Make it memorable and emotionally engaging
- Use real examples and customer stories when possible

## Standard Pitch Deck Structure

### 1. Title Slide
- **Company name and logo**
- **Tagline/one-liner**: What you do in 10 words or less
- **Contact information** (optional on title, required at end)

### 2. Problem
- **Identify a real pain point**: What problem are you solving?
- **Quantify the problem**: Use data and statistics
- **Make it relatable**: Use examples or stories
- **Show urgency**: Why does this need to be solved now?

**Example bullet points:**
- "70% of small businesses struggle with cash flow management"
- "Current solutions are complex, expensive, and time-consuming"
- "This costs SMBs $10B+ annually in lost productivity"

### 3. Solution
- **Present your product/service**: How does it solve the problem?
- **Key features/benefits**: Focus on outcomes, not just features
- **Unique value proposition**: What makes your solution special?
- **Demo or visual**: Show, don't just tell

**Example bullet points:**
- "AI-powered cash flow forecasting in real-time"
- "Automated payment reminders reduce late payments by 50%"
- "Simple interface that takes 5 minutes to set up"

### 4. Market Opportunity
- **Total Addressable Market (TAM)**: Total market demand
- **Serviceable Available Market (SAM)**: Market you can reach
- **Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM)**: Market you can realistically capture
- **Market trends**: Growth rate, tailwinds, market drivers

**Example structure:**
- "TAM: $50B global market for SMB financial software"
- "SAM: $10B addressable with our go-to-market strategy"

### 5. Product

### 6. Traction

### 7. Business Model

- "85% gross margins, path to profitability clear"

### 8. Competition
- **Competitive landscape**: Who else is in the market?
- **Competitive advantages**: Why are you better/different?
- **Barriers to entry**: What protects your position?

**Approaches:**
- **Competitor matrix**: 2x2 grid showing positioning
- **Feature comparison table**: Your features vs. competitors
- **"Secret sauce"**: What's your unfair advantage?

**Example structure:**
- Competitors: List 3-5 main competitors

### 10. Financials & Ask
- **Financial projections**: 3-5 year forecast (revenue, key metrics)
- **Funding ask**: How much are you raising?
- **Use of funds**: What will you spend it on?
- **Milestones**: What will you achieve with this funding?

**Example structure:**

- "Use of funds: 60% engineering, 25% sales, 15% ops"
- "Milestones: Launch v2, reach $1M ARR, expand to 3 new markets"
- "12-18 month runway to Series A"

## Design Best Practices

### Visual Hierarchy
- **Large, bold titles**: Make slide topics clear
- **Limited text per slide**: 3-5 bullet points max
- **Consistent formatting**: Same fonts, colors, spacing throughout

### Color Scheme
- **Stick to 2-3 colors**: Brand colors + neutral gray
- **High contrast**: Ensure readability
- **Professional appearance**: Avoid gaudy or distracting colors

### Typography
- **Sans-serif fonts**: Modern, clean appearance (e.g., Helvetica, Arial, Roboto)
- **Readable font sizes**: Minimum 20pt for body text, 36pt+ for titles
- **Consistent hierarchy**: Title, subtitle, body text clearly differentiated

### Data Visualization
- **Use charts and graphs**: Better than tables or text for trends
- **Simple charts**: Avoid 3D effects and unnecessary complexity
- **Highlight key points**: Use color or annotations to draw attention

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Content Mistakes
- **Too much text**: Slides should support your talk, not replace it
- **Vague claims**: "Revolutionary," "disruptive" without evidence
- **Ignoring competition**: Claiming no competitors is a red flag
- **Missing traction**: Especially for later-stage companies
- **Unrealistic projections**: "Hockey stick" growth without justification

### Design Mistakes
- **Inconsistent branding**: Different fonts, colors, styles
- **Low-quality images**: Pixelated or stretched images
- **Cluttered slides**: Too many elements competing for attention
- **Animations and transitions**: Usually distracting, keep minimal

### Presentation Mistakes
- **Reading slides word-for-word**: Slides support your narrative
- **Going over time**: Practice to stay within time limits
- **Lack of energy**: Enthusiasm is contagious
- **Not knowing your numbers**: Be prepared for deep dives on metrics
