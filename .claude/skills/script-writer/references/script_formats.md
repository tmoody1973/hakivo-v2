4. **Talking too fast** - Leave room for visuals
5. **Being too formal** - YouTube is conversational
6. **No personality** - Let your unique voice shine
7. **Forgetting the CTA** - Always guide next steps
8. **Too much information** - Focus on key takeaways

## Visual Cues in Scripts

Include directions for yourself:

[B-roll: Show example of X]
[On-screen text: "Key Point"]
[Cut to close-up]
[Show product]
[Demonstrate step]

```

These help during filming and editing.
