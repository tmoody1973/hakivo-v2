**Subject:** Reconnecting + A New Civic Tech Project I Think You'd Find Interesting

Hi Susan,

I hope this email finds you well! A couple of years ago, I was working on a chatbot tool using your API to help voters access information more easily. Life got in the way and I never got the chance to finish it, but the experience stuck with me.

I wanted to reach out because I've been working on something new that I think aligns with the mission of U.S. Vote Foundation, and I'd love to share it with you.

## Introducing Hakivo

I built **Hakivo**, a civic intelligence platform that helps everyday people stay informed about what's happening in Congress and their state legislature—without needing hours to read dense legal documents.

**Here's what it does:**

- **Tracks legislation by topic** — Users pick issues they care about (healthcare, education, environment, etc.) and Hakivo automatically finds and follows relevant bills
- **Explains bills in plain English** — AI summarizes complex legislation into clear, understandable language
- **Creates personalized audio briefings** — Daily podcast-style updates users can listen to while commuting or getting ready in the morning
- **Finds your representatives** — Enter an address and instantly see federal and state legislators with photos, contact info, and voting records
- **AI assistant** — Ask questions like "What bills are being proposed about voting rights?" and get real-time answers with sources

The idea is simple: democracy works better when citizens are informed, but most people don't have time to dig through Congress.gov. Hakivo bridges that gap.

## Built for a Hackathon, Growing Into Something Bigger

I originally built Hakivo for a hackathon competition. But I'm now planning to develop it further with guidance from a mentor who works at OpenAI. The goal is to make civic engagement more accessible to everyone—especially busy people who want to participate in democracy but don't know where to start.

Given your work helping millions of voters access the tools they need, I thought you might find this interesting. I'd love to hear your thoughts or any feedback you might have.

Thanks for taking the time to read this, and I hope we can reconnect!

Best,
Tarik Moody
