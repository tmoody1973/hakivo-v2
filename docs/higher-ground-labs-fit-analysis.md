## Higher Ground Labs: What They Actually Fund

## Hakivo: Current Reality

### What Hakivo Is
- **B2C consumer product** ($12/month subscription)
- **Civic education platform** for individual citizens
- **Politically neutral** - tracks all legislators regardless of party
- **Legislative tracking** - bills, votes, representative actions
- **AI-powered briefings** - NPR-style audio summaries
- **Personal civic awareness** - not voter mobilization

### What Hakivo Is NOT
- A campaign tool
- A voter mobilization platform
- A progressive/left-aligned product
- A B2B offering for organizations
- A direct-voter-contact system

## The Gap: Why Hakivo Doesn't Fit HGL

| Dimension | HGL Requirement | Hakivo Reality |
|-----------|-----------------|----------------|
| **Customer** | Campaigns, PACs, progressive orgs | Individual consumers |
| **Business Model** | B2B SaaS | B2C subscription |
| **Political Alignment** | Explicitly progressive/Democratic | Politically neutral |
| **Primary Outcome** | Help candidates WIN elections | Help citizens UNDERSTAND government |
| **Value Proposition** | Voter contact, fundraising, organizing | Legislative awareness, civic education |
| **Scale Model** | Deploy across many campaigns | Grow consumer subscriber base |

### The Core Problem
Hakivo makes people better informed citizens. HGL funds tools that make progressive candidates win elections. **These are fundamentally different missions.**

A well-informed voter might vote Republican. HGL wouldn't fund that outcome.

## Ultrathink: How Might Hakivo Become HGL-Eligible?

To transform Hakivo into an HGL candidate, we'd need to answer these design questions:

### How Might We... Turn Civic Awareness Into Voter Mobilization?

**Current State**: Users learn what's happening in Congress
**HGL-Ready State**: Users take action that helps progressive candidates

**Potential Features**:
1. **"Your Legislator's Record" Report Cards**
   - Automatically score legislators on progressive priorities
   - Compare to progressive challenger positions
   - "Your rep voted against climate 87% of the time"

2. **Election Reminders + Progressive Voter Guides**
   - Integrate with election calendars
   - Serve progressive endorsement information
   - "Here's who [progressive org] endorses in your district"

3. **Civic Action Queue**
   - Move beyond "here's what happened" to "here's what you can do"
   - Call scripts, email templates, petition links
   - Track user actions (calls made, emails sent)

### How Might We... Create B2B Value for Campaigns?

**Current State**: Consumer subscription model
**HGL-Ready State**: Campaign/org pricing tier with mobilization tools

**Potential Features**:
1. **"Hakivo for Campaigns" Tier**
   - Bulk user onboarding for supporter lists
   - Campaign-branded briefings highlighting contrast
   - Integration with campaign CRMs (NGP VAN, etc.)

2. **Supporter Engagement Dashboard**
   - Track which supporters are opening briefings
   - Identify most engaged supporters for volunteer asks
   - "Your top 100 most engaged supporters this week"

3. **Issue Alert Broadcasting**
   - Let campaigns push urgent legislative moments to supporters
   - "Your senator is voting on X tomorrow - call now"
   - Integration with relational organizing tools

### How Might We... Align With Progressive Values?

**Current State**: Politically neutral legislative tracking
**HGL-Ready State**: Explicitly progressive civic engagement

**Potential Features**:
1. **Progressive Policy Lens**
   - Score all bills on progressive criteria
   - Highlight corporate influence, special interests
   - "This bill is backed by Big Pharma lobbyists"

2. **Movement Integration**
   - Partner with progressive orgs (Sierra Club, Planned Parenthood, etc.)
   - Surface their legislative priorities
   - Enable direct-to-action funnels

3. **"Power Mapping" Features**
   - Show corporate donations to legislators
   - Track revolving door (staffers to lobbyists)
   - Expose conflicts of interest

## Honest Trade-offs to Consider

### If You Pursue HGL Alignment

**Gains**:
- Access to $50M+ progressive tech ecosystem
- Network of 70+ portfolio companies (partnerships)
- Credibility in progressive political tech
- Potential customers (campaigns, orgs)

**Losses**:
- Half your potential market (conservatives, independents)
- Brand positioning as "neutral civic tool"
- Some existing users who don't want political advocacy
- Product simplicity (adding mobilization = complexity)

### The Fundamental Question

> Do you want Hakivo to be a **civic education platform for all Americans** or a **progressive voter mobilization tool**?

These are different products with different markets, different funding sources, and different measures of success.

---

## Alternative Funding Paths (If You Stay Neutral)

If you want to keep Hakivo politically neutral, HGL isn't the right fit. Consider:

1. **Democracy Fund** - Funds nonpartisan civic engagement
2. **Knight Foundation** - Supports informed citizenry initiatives
3. **Omidyar Network** - Invests in civic tech regardless of political alignment
4. **General consumer VCs** - If you can prove B2C subscription growth
5. **NEA/Accel/a16z** - If you can show "civic tech as consumer category"

---

## Recommendation

### Short-Term (If You Want HGL)
1. Add a "Hakivo for Campaigns" B2B tier
2. Build supporter engagement tracking
3. Integrate with one progressive org (pilot)
4. Reposition marketing toward "activate progressive voters"

### Long-Term (If You Stay Neutral)
1. Pursue nonpartisan civic tech funding
2. Build B2C growth metrics (retention, engagement)
3. Position as "the future of civic media" vs "progressive tool"
4. Explore B2B2C through nonpartisan orgs (League of Women Voters, etc.)

---

## Conclusion

Hakivo as it exists today is a civic education platform. Higher Ground Labs funds campaign technology. These serve different purposes.

You can transform Hakivo into an HGL candidate, but it requires:
- Adding B2B campaign features
- Taking an explicit progressive stance
- Shifting from "inform citizens" to "mobilize voters"

That's a significant pivot with real trade-offs. The question isn't "can Hakivo fit HGL?" but "should it?"

Only you can answer that.
