## Slide 2: The Problem
**Title:** "The Progressive Tech Talent Crisis"

**Three Big Problems:**
1. **The Pipeline Problem**
   - 10,000+ progressive organizations
   - <100 progressive tech developers
   - 2-3 years to train a developer
   - $200K+ education cost

2. **The Resource Problem**
   - Average campaign tech budget: $50K
   - Average custom tool cost: $200K+
   - Timeline to build: 6-12 months
   - Elections don't wait for development cycles

3. **The Innovation Gap**
   - Republicans outspending on tech 3:1
   - Progressive orgs using 10-year-old tools
   - Can't compete with Koch network resources
   - Local campaigns have zero tech capacity

## Pitch Delivery Notes

### Opening Hook (30 seconds)
"What if every progressive organizer could build their own campaign tools without learning to code? I'm a radio host who built a platform competing with $230M-funded companies using only AI. Let me show you how we can teach 1,000 progressives to do the same."

### Key Transitions
- Problem → Solution: "I discovered something that changes everything..."
- Proof → Methodology: "Here's how anyone can replicate this..."
- Vision → Ask: "Together, we can transform progressive tech capacity..."

### Closing Statement (30 seconds)
"The Republicans are outspending us on tech 3 to 1. We can't outspend them, but we can out-build them. Give me 15 progressive organizers and one day. I'll give you 15 new tech leaders who can build their own tools. Let's start in Wisconsin and scale nationally."
