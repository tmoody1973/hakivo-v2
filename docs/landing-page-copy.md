## Problem Section

### Section Header
**Democracy Shouldn't Feel Like Homework**

### Pain Points

#### 1. Information Overload
**Congress passes thousands of bills every session.**
Most people don't have time to read dense legal text or parse through congressional records. Important legislation slips by unnoticed.

#### 2. Complexity
**Legislative language isn't designed for everyday citizens.**
Bills are written by lawyers for lawyers. Understanding what's actually being proposed shouldn't require a law degree.

#### 3. Disconnection
**Most Americans can't name their congressional representatives.**
And even if they could, they don't know how those representatives are voting on issues that matter to them.

#### 4. Time Barrier
**You have 5 minutes, not 5 hours.**
Between work, family, and life, who has time to follow C-SPAN? Civic engagement shouldn't be a full-time job.
