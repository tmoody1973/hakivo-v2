**The Future of Local News Is Personal—And I Built It Without a $100 Million Fund**

Last week, the Aspen Institute released *"The Future of Public Media"* report, outlining a vision for rebuilding local journalism in America. The findings are sobering: 210 counties have no local news source, over one-third of newspapers have disappeared, and 43 million Americans could lose local news service within a year.

The report calls for "bold and audacious moves" and suggests that current approaches to public media are "completely antiquated." It advocates for moving "from governance first to audience first" and emphasizes "citizenship over consumption."

I couldn't agree more. That's why I built Hakivo.

**What Is Hakivo?**

Hakivo delivers personalized daily news briefings about Congress—tailored to each user's location and interests. Every morning, users receive a brief that covers:

- Legislation from *their* senators and representatives
- Bills in policy areas *they* care about (healthcare, defense, environment, etc.)
- State-level legislation affecting *their* community
- Related news with sources and context

Here's an example from today: [America Bets on AI to Win the Next War](https://hakivo.com/briefs/3069fa29-5e97-4962-9c65-488685bf8c70)

This brief was generated for a user in Texas. It covers Senator John Cornyn's AI defense legislation (the GUARD Act), Texas health policy debates, and state bills—all personalized to what matters to that specific reader.

**How It Works (In Plain English)**

1. **You tell us where you live and what you care about.** Your zip code determines your Congressional representatives. Your interests (healthcare, immigration, technology, etc.) filter the thousands of bills in Congress down to what's relevant to you.

2. **Every day, we gather the news.** Hakivo pulls from Congress.gov for legislation, state legislature APIs for local bills, and trusted news sources for context.

3. **AI writes your personal brief.** Using the latest AI models, Hakivo synthesizes this information into a cohesive narrative—written specifically for you, mentioning your representatives by name.

4. **You can listen or read.** Each brief includes AI-generated audio narration, so you can catch up on Congress during your commute.

5. **Everything links to primary sources.** Every bill mentioned links to Congress.gov. Every news story links to the original reporting.

**Why This Matters**

The Aspen report highlights that among adults under 30, trust in national news and social media personalities is roughly equal. Young audiences "expect journalists to be community members, not distant observers."

Hakivo addresses this directly. When your daily brief opens with "Good morning, [Your Name]. Your senator, [Their Name], just introduced a bill that affects [Your Interest]..."—that's not distant. That's personal. That's relevant.

**The Innovation Gap**

The Public Media Bridge Fund aims to raise $100 million to stabilize local journalism. That's important work, and I support it.

But while institutions deliberate on ten-year strategic blueprints, individual builders are shipping solutions today.

I built Hakivo as a solo developer—no venture funding, no institutional backing, no grants. Just a belief that civic information should be accessible, personal, and useful.

This isn't a criticism of institutional efforts. It's a reminder that innovation doesn't require permission. The tools exist. The data is public. The AI capabilities are available to anyone willing to learn them.

**Imagine the Possibilities**

I built Hakivo without funding. Now imagine what's possible with resources.

I spent over a decade at Radio Milwaukee (88Nine), helping build one of the most innovative public radio stations in the country. I've seen firsthand what public media can accomplish when it embraces new ideas and serves its community authentically.

Imagine if independent builders like me partnered with public media institutions that have the trust, the audience, and the mission—but need the technical innovation. Imagine personalized civic briefings delivered through your local NPR station's app. Imagine every public radio listener receiving a daily update tailored to their community, their representatives, their concerns.

The Aspen report is right: public media needs "bold and audacious moves." This is what bold looks like. Not another committee or another decade-long strategic plan—but working technology, built by people who understand both the mission and the medium.

**What's Next**

Hakivo is live and free to use. If you believe that informed citizens make better decisions, I'd love for you to try it:

The future of public media might require $100 million and a decade of planning. Or it might just require one person who decides to build it anyway—and an institution brave enough to say "let's do this together."
