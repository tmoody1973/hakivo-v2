# Code for America Summit 2025 - Demo Lab Proposal

## Demo Title
**Hakivo: Your AI-Powered Legislative Aide** (6 words)

---

## Goal / Desired Outcome

My goal is to show civic technologists how AI can radically lower the barrier to civic engagement by meeting people where they already are—in their earbuds. I want attendees to leave understanding that civic tech doesn't have to mean dense databases and confusing interfaces. By demonstrating how Hakivo transforms complex legislation into personalized daily audio briefings, I hope to inspire new approaches to accessibility in civic technology and spark conversations about using AI responsibly to strengthen democracy rather than undermine it.

## Demo Description
(149 words)

Hakivo reimagines civic engagement as a personalized audio experience—your "Morning Edition" for democracy. Users select policy interests and location, then receive daily AI-generated briefings tailored to *their* representatives, *their* state legislation, and *their* issues. It's civic intelligence that fits into a commute.

The platform also features "Signed Into Law," an AI-created educational podcast series covering 100 landmark laws from 1900-2000. Each episode synthesizes historical research, legislative context, and lasting impact into accessible 15-minute stories—demonstrating how AI can transform dense data into compelling learning experiences at scale.

The demo showcases:
- **Personalized Daily Briefs**: AI analyzes Congress.gov data against user interests to generate morning audio updates
- **Educational Podcast**: AI-produced series making legislative history engaging and accessible
- **Congressional Assistant**: AI agent that uses real-time tools to search Congress.gov, analyze bills, and generate reports

Built by a non-technical founder using Claude Code. Live at hakivo.com.
