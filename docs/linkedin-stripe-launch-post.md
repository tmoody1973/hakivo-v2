# LinkedIn Post - First Paid Product Launch

---

I built something. And someone told me I should charge for it.

That terrified me.

For the past few months, I've been building Hakivo—an AI-powered civic engagement platform that turns Congressional legislation into personalized daily audio briefings. Think "Morning Edition" for democracy, delivered to your earbuds.

When I started thinking about actually charging for it, imposter syndrome hit hard. Who am I to ask people to pay for something I built? I'm not a "real" developer. I built this thing with Claude Code and stubborn persistence—not a CS degree.

Then something happened that gave me a push. A little over a week ago, Plural Policy—a similar civic tech platform founded by Black founders with actual VC investment—got acquired. Seeing that gave me a jolt of confidence. Maybe I'm onto something here. Maybe this space has real potential.

If you solve a real problem, you've built something of value. And value deserves compensation.

So this week, I did the thing that scared me most. I integrated Stripe. I'm currently testing the payment flow before going live.

And honestly? I'm nervous. Really nervous.

Putting Hakivo out there as a paid service feels like standing naked in a spotlight. What if it breaks? What if people hate it? What if no one thinks it's worth $12/month? Every insecurity I have as a builder is screaming at me right now.

But I'm doing it anyway.

When I flip that switch, Hakivo will become the first product I've ever built that generates revenue.

Not a side project. Not a prototype. Not "something I'm working on." A real product.

I'm sharing this because I know I'm not alone. There are so many builders out there—especially non-traditional ones—who create incredible things but struggle to believe they're "allowed" to charge for them.

You are. We are.

If you're sitting on something valuable, wondering if it's "good enough" to monetize—this is your sign. The fear doesn't go away. You just move forward anyway.

More updates soon. For now, back to testing.
