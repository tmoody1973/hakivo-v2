## Tips for Better Results

1. **Be Specific**: "What is HR 1234?" works better than "Tell me about recent bills"
2. **Ask Follow-ups**: Build on previous answers in the same conversation
3. **Use Bill Numbers**: When you know them, bill numbers get precise results
4. **Specify Timeframes**: "Bills introduced this month" vs "recent bills"

## Limitations

The Congressional Assistant:
- Focuses on U.S. federal legislation (state bills have limited coverage)
- May not have information on very recent events (within hours)
