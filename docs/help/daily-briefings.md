# Daily Briefings

Daily briefings are personalized audio summaries of Congressional activity tailored to your interests. Listen while commuting, exercising, or during your morning routine.

## How Briefings Work

Each day, Hakivo's AI analyzes:
- New bills introduced in Congress
- Committee hearings and markups
- Floor votes and actions
- News related to your policy interests

This information is synthesized into a concise audio briefing, typically 5-15 minutes long.
