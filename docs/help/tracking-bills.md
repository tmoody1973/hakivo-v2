# Tracking Bills

Stay informed about the legislation that matters to you by tracking bills. When you track a bill, you'll receive updates on its progress through Congress.

## Finding Bills to Track

### Search for Bills
1. Navigate to **Legislation** in the main menu
2. Use the search bar to find bills by:
   - Bill number (e.g., "HR 1234", "S 567")
   - Keywords in the title
   - Topic or subject matter
   - Sponsor name

### Browse Bills
- Filter by status: Introduced, In Committee, Passed House, Passed Senate, Signed into Law
- Filter by type: House Bills (H.R.), Senate Bills (S.), Resolutions
- Sort by date introduced or recent activity

### Discover Through the Assistant
Ask the Congressional Assistant questions like:
- "What bills about healthcare were introduced this week?"
- "Show me climate legislation"
- "Find bills sponsored by my representative"

Bill cards in responses include a Track button for easy tracking.
