# LinkedIn Outreach - Nick Mastronardi (Polco CEO)

## Connection Note Option 1 (Winner - 293 characters)
```
Hi Nick - Fellow Wisconsin civic tech founder here. Built Hakivo (state/federal legislative tracking) using AI as my sole developer. Seeing natural synergy with Polco's local gov focus - your clients ask about state bills affecting them. Would love to grab coffee in Madison and explore. -Tarik
```

## Connection Note Option 2 (297 characters)
```
Nick - I'm a Milwaukee radio host who built an AI-powered platform tracking state/federal legislation. Polco owns local govt intelligence; Hakivo could be your state/federal layer. Built entire platform with AI, no code. Wisconsin civic tech should stick together. Coffee in Madison? -Tarik Moody
```

## Connection Note Option 3 (299 characters)
```
Hi Nick - Admire what you've built with Polco. I've solved the state/federal legislative tracking problem using only AI to build Hakivo (zero coding, 50K lines generated). Your local gov clients need state bill intel - perfect complement. 20 min from you in Milwaukee. Worth a quick chat? -Tarik
```

## Connection Note Option 4 (Brief - 276 characters)
```
Nick - Built Hakivo to track WI state + federal bills using only AI (radio host, not developer). Polco handles local brilliantly; we could give your 500 cities state/federal intelligence. Both Wisconsin civic tech. Natural fit? Coffee between Madison/Milwaukee? -Tarik @ 88Nine
```

## Connection Note Option 5 (Direct - 295 characters)
```
Nick - You've conquered local gov engagement. I've built state/federal legislative tracking using AI as my CTO (seriously, I'm a radio host who can't code). Hakivo + Polco = complete civic intelligence stack. Wisconsin synergy worth exploring? Can demo AI-building live over coffee. -Tarik

## Follow-Up Message (After Connection Accepted)

```
Nick,

Thanks for connecting! Quick context on why I reached out:

Polco brilliantly serves local governments, but I bet your clients constantly get asked "How will that state bill affect our city?" or "What's Congress doing about infrastructure funding?"

I built Hakivo to solve exactly that - tracking every bill in Wisconsin legislature + Congress, with AI analysis explaining impact in plain English. The kicker: I built it entirely with AI (I'm a radio host at 88Nine, not a developer).

The synergy I see:
• Polco Dashboard: "Your city's pulse"
• + Hakivo Layer: "State & federal bills affecting your city"
• = Complete civic intelligence

Would you be open to a 30-minute coffee in Madison? I can show you how I built Hakivo with AI (it's mind-blowing what's possible now) and explore if there's a partnership fit.

Best times for me are Tuesday/Thursday afternoons. Happy to drive to Middleton.

Best,
Tarik Moody

## Key Strategy Notes

### Why These Work:
1. **Wisconsin Connection** - Immediate common ground
2. **Complementary Positioning** - Not competitive, additive
3. **AI Hook** - Unique and intriguing
4. **Specific Value** - State/federal layer for local gov
5. **Easy Ask** - Coffee is low commitment
6. **Credibility** - Radio host adds uniqueness

### What NOT to Say:
- Don't mention only having 12 users
- Don't position as needing help
- Don't make it about acquisition immediately
- Don't emphasize technical details
- Don't make it seem desperate

### Best Approach:
- Use Option 1 for initial connection (most balanced)
- Wait 24-48 hours after acceptance to send follow-up
- If no response to follow-up after 1 week, try email
- Offer to meet him in Middleton (shows commitment)

### The Hook That Matters:
"Radio host builds platform with AI" - This is irresistible to someone with AI interest like Nick

## Email Backup (If LinkedIn Doesn't Work)

**Subject:** Wisconsin Civic Tech Synergy - State/Federal Intel for Polco Cities

```
Hi Nick,

I'm Tarik Moody, founder of Hakivo here in Milwaukee. Huge admirer of what you've built with Polco - especially your recent AI initiatives with Polly and Grace.

I've built something that might interest you: AI-powered state and federal legislative tracking. Here's the unique part - I built the entire platform using AI as my developer (I'm actually a radio host at 88Nine, not a programmer).

The synergy I see: When Madison asks "How will that state bill affect our budget?" - Polco + Hakivo could provide the complete answer.

Would you be open to coffee in Madison? I can demo how I built this with AI (revolutionary for civic tech) and explore if there's a natural partnership.

Best,
Tarik Moody
