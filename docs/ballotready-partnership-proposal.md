# BallotReady Partnership Proposal

**Prepared by:** Tarik Moody, Founder of Hakivo
**Date:** December 2025
**Version:** 1.0

---

## Executive Summary

Hakivo is a civic intelligence platform that provides personalized legislative briefings, AI-powered bill analysis, and representative accountability tracking. Built entirely with Claude Code by a non-technical founder, Hakivo demonstrates the future of AI-assisted civic technology development.

This proposal outlines a strategic partnership between BallotReady and Hakivo that creates a complete civic engagement lifecycle: **Vote → Track → Engage → Vote Informed**.

---

## The Civic Engagement Gap

### Current State

| Platform | Focus | User Journey |
|----------|-------|--------------|
| **BallotReady** | Pre-election | Research ballot → Register → Vote |
| **Hakivo** | Post-election | Track bills → Analyze impact → Hold accountable |

### The Problem

- BallotReady engagement spikes during elections, then drops 80%+ until the next cycle
- Citizens vote, then lose track of what their representatives actually do
- No bridge between "who to vote for" and "are they doing what they promised?"

### The Opportunity

Combined platform creates **year-round civic engagement**:

```
BallotReady (Election) → Hakivo (Accountability) → BallotReady (Re-election)
                              ↑
                    Continuous engagement loop
```

## Proposed Partnership Tiers

### Tier 1: Data Integration (Low Investment)

**What BallotReady Provides:**
- Candidate position data and endorsements

- Bill sponsorship and co-sponsorship data
- AI-generated "promise vs. action" reports

**User Value:**

- Pre-election: Show incumbent's actual record vs. campaign promises

**Implementation:** API data sharing, 2-4 weeks integration

---

### Tier 2: White-Label Legislative Module (Medium Investment)

**Features for BallotReady Users:**
- Track bills your representatives sponsor
- AI-powered bill summaries in plain English

---

### Tier 3: Strategic Investment & Co-Development (High Investment)

**Proposal:** BallotReady invests in Hakivo development in exchange for:

1. **Exclusive civic tech AI capabilities** - First access to new AI features
2. **Joint product roadmap** - Co-design features that serve both platforms
3. **Shared user base** - Cross-promotion and unified accounts
4. **Technology transfer** - Hakivo's AI architecture for BallotReady's platform

**Investment Use:**
- Scale infrastructure for millions of users
- Expand state legislature coverage (currently 49 states)
- Build mobile applications
- Hire dedicated support team

---

## Unique Combined Features to Build

### 1. Campaign Promise Tracker

**Concept:** Track what candidates promise during campaigns, then monitor their legislative actions

**How It Works:**
```
Election Season (BallotReady data):
- Candidate promises "lower taxes"
- Candidate endorses "climate action"
- Candidate opposes "gun control"

Post-Election (Hakivo tracking):
- AI monitors all votes on tax bills → Score: 73% aligned
- AI monitors climate legislation → Score: 45% aligned
- AI monitors gun bills → Score: 91% aligned

Result: "Promise Alignment Score" for each representative
```

**User Value:** "Did they do what they said they'd do?"

**Technical Build:**
- Ingest BallotReady candidate position data
- Map positions to bill categories
- AI scoring algorithm for alignment
- Dashboard widget showing promise vs. reality

---

### 2. Informed Voter Briefing

**Concept:** Before each election, generate personalized AI briefing on incumbents

**Features:**
- Summary of key votes in current term
- Bills they sponsored that passed/failed
- Comparison to campaign promises
- AI-generated "report card" by policy area

**Delivery:**
- Email digest 30 days before election
- Push notification with key insights
- Shareable social media cards

**Integration:** Triggered by BallotReady's election calendar API

---

### 3. Representative Accountability Alerts

**Concept:** Real-time notifications when your rep takes action on issues you care about

**User Flow:**
1. User selects policy interests (Environment, Healthcare, etc.)
2. Hakivo monitors all votes and bill actions
3. Alert: "Your Senator voted YES on HR 1234 - Clean Energy Act"
4. One-click: Contact rep to thank/oppose

**BallotReady Value:** Keeps users engaged between elections

---

## Competitive Positioning

| **GovTrack** | No AI analysis, no personalization, no audio |
| **Congress.gov** | Raw data only, no insights, poor UX |
