### We're Building in Public - Join Us! 🚧

Hey Hakivo community!

Today marks a big milestone - we're officially in **PUBLIC BETA** and building Hakivo together with you!

### What's New This Week:

**✅ Beta Program Launch**
- You'll now see a beta banner on every page
- Direct link to report issues and request features (that's here!)
- New pricing page section explaining how your support helps us compete with $230M-funded competitors

**✅ Major Fixes**
- **No more duplicate daily briefings!** Fixed the scheduler bug
- **Featured Legislation is back!** Bill tracking now displays properly
- **Better audio generation** - Near 100% reliability
- **Gamma exports work** - Your AI presentations download correctly

**✅ Behind the Scenes**

- **100%** brief generation success rate on Dec 29
- **81%** of all briefs now have complete bill tracking
- **0** duplicate briefs since the fix

### What Makes This Special 🚀

I want to be transparent with you: Hakivo is built by **one person (me!) using AI as my co-developer**. No team of engineers, no VC funding - just me, Claude AI, and your feedback.

When you report a bug here, I can literally fix it in minutes using AI and deploy immediately. When you request a feature, there's no committee or sprint planning - if it makes sense, I build it.

Your $12/month subscription isn't going to investors - it's keeping the servers running and giving me time to build YOUR requested features.

### How You Can Help 🤝

1. **Report bugs** - Even small ones. I can fix them fast
2. **Request features** - What would make Hakivo perfect for you?
3. **Share feedback** - What's confusing? What's great?
4. **Spread the word** - Help us grow the beta community

### Coming Next (Based on YOUR Feedback):
- Mobile app (most requested!)
- More state coverage
- Custom alerts
- Better exports

### A Personal Note 💭

Building Hakivo while working at NPR has been incredible. Using AI, I've built in 8 months what competitors spent years and millions creating. But the real magic isn't the AI - it's having users like you who believe in this vision of accessible democracy.

Every bug you report makes us stronger. Every feature request shapes our roadmap. You're not just users - you're co-builders.

Thank you for being here during beta. You're the reason Hakivo exists.

Let's keep building together!

-Tarik Moody
Director of Strategy & Innovation, 88Nine Radio Milwaukee (NPR)
Founder, Hakivo

P.S. - Fun fact: Even this announcement was written with AI assistance. The future of software isn't about writing code - it's about solving problems. And we're solving them together!

### LinkedIn:
Excited to announce Hakivo is entering public beta!

What started as an experiment - can one person with AI compete with venture-backed companies? - is now a reality.

In 8 months, using Claude AI as my co-developer, I've built what FiscalNote spent $230M and 7 years creating.

But here's what matters: We're building this WITH our users, not for them.

Every beta user has a direct line to shape the product. Report a bug? Fixed in minutes. Request a feature? Shipped in days.

This is what building in public with AI looks like.
