## Press Release #1: TechCrunch/Main Tech Media

### FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

**NPR Station Executive and Former Architect Proves Non-Technical Founders Can Build Million-Dollar SaaS Using Only AI**

*Tarik Moody, Director of Strategy and Innovation at Radio Milwaukee, Built 50,000 Lines of Production Code Without Writing a Single Line Himself, Competing with $230M-Funded FiscalNote*

**MILWAUKEE, WI – January 1, 2025** – While serving as Director of Strategy and Innovation at 88Nine Radio Milwaukee, an NPR member station, Tarik Moody has achieved what Silicon Valley VCs say is impossible: building a sophisticated government technology platform competing with venture-backed unicorns—without knowing how to code.

Hakivo, Moody's AI-powered legislative intelligence platform, tracks every bill across all 50 state legislatures and Congress, generates plain-English analysis, and delivers personalized audio briefings as daily podcasts. The entire platform—over 50,000 lines of TypeScript, React, and Python code—was written by Claude AI under Moody's direction.

"I'm living proof that the biggest barrier to innovation just disappeared," said Moody, a Howard University graduate who practiced architecture before transitioning to media innovation. "While my competitors raised $230 million and hired 500 engineers, I built comparable functionality for under $10,000 using AI as my technical co-founder."

The platform showcases a fundamental shift in software development. Where traditional startups need $500K-$1M in seed funding just to build an MVP, Moody spent $300/month on cloud services and API calls. Where competitors take 2-3 years to reach market, Hakivo launched in 8 months.

**By the Numbers:**
- **Development cost:** $10,000 (vs. typical $500K+ for similar platforms)
- **Time to market:** 8 months (vs. 2-3 years industry standard)
- **Team size:** 1 non-technical founder + AI (vs. 5-10 engineers)
- **Code base:** 50,000+ lines, all AI-generated
- **Coverage:** Federal + 49 state legislatures (100,000+ bills tracked)
- **Operating cost:** $300/month (vs. $100K+/month for competitors)

"This isn't about no-code tools or templates," Moody emphasizes. "This is production-ready, enterprise-grade software architecture—Cloudflare Workers, Supabase, TypeScript—built entirely through natural language conversations with AI."

The implications extend far beyond one platform. If a radio host can build software that competes with FiscalNote (500+ employees, $100M revenue), Quorum ($75M raised), and GovTrack, what does this mean for the $500 billion software industry?

Major tech investors are taking notice. "We're seeing the democratization of software development happen in real-time," said a partner at a prominent Silicon Valley firm who requested anonymity. "Non-technical founders with deep domain expertise and AI tools will disrupt every vertical."

Moody, who previously founded HYFIN, Radio Milwaukee's urban alternative station, and hosts the syndicated Rhythm Lab Radio show for over 20 years, has documented his entire development process. "Every prompt, every architectural decision, every deployment—it's all documented in plain English. Any founder can replicate this."

The platform is currently available at hakivo.com with both free and premium tiers. But the real product might be the methodology itself—proof that AI has eliminated the technical founder requirement that has gatekept innovation for decades.

For a live demonstration of building features with AI or to schedule an interview where Moody will build new functionality on camera, contact tarik@hakivo.com.

## Press Release #2: AI/Future of Work Angle

### FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

**The End of "Technical Co-Founder Needed": NPR Executive and Former Architect Ships Enterprise Software Using Claude AI as CTO**

*Milwaukee's Tarik Moody Builds Legislative Tracking Platform That Would Cost VCs $5M, Spending Only $10K and Zero Engineering Salaries*

**MILWAUKEE, WI – January 1, 2025** – The most disruptive force in software development isn't a new programming language or framework—it's eliminating programmers entirely from the equation. Tarik Moody, Director of Strategy and Innovation at Milwaukee's 88Nine Radio (NPR) with zero coding experience, just proved it by building Hakivo, a platform that rivals $100M competitor FiscalNote.

Using Claude AI as his technical co-founder, Moody directed the creation of a sophisticated legislative intelligence system that tracks bills across Congress and 49 state legislatures, generates AI-powered analysis, and produces daily audio briefings. The entire codebase—React frontend, TypeScript backend, Python data processing—was written through conversational AI.

"Every accelerator application asks for your technical co-founder. Every investor wants to meet your CTO," said Moody, who balances radio hosting with AI-powered development. "I found my technical co-founder. It's AI. And unlike human CTOs, it never asks for equity."

**The New Development Stack:**
- **IDE:** Claude AI interface
- **Programming Language:** English
- **Debugging:** Conversation
- **Code Review:** AI-powered analysis
- **Deployment:** Natural language commands
- **Cost:** $20/month for Claude subscription

The platform's architecture rivals any Series A startup: Cloudflare Workers for edge computing, Supabase for real-time data, Gemini for TTS audio generation, and integration with Congress.gov and OpenStates APIs. Yet not a single line was typed by human hands.

"We're witnessing the birth of Prompt-Driven Development (PDD)," says Moody. "While everyone debates whether AI will replace junior developers, I'm shipping features faster than most senior engineering teams."

The implications for the $500 billion software industry are staggering:
- **Startup costs drop 95%** (from $500K to $25K)
- **Time to market shrinks 80%** (from 2 years to 6 months)
- **Technical talent shortage becomes irrelevant**
- **Domain experts can build their own tools**

Moody, a Howard University architecture graduate who transitioned from designing buildings to designing media experiences, continues his executive role while running Hakivo. "I went from designing physical spaces as an architect to designing sonic spaces at HYFIN to now designing digital spaces with AI. Each transition taught me that expertise transfers—you just need the right tools."

The methodology is reproducible. Moody has open-sourced his prompt engineering techniques and offers workshops for non-technical founders. "If a radio host can compete with unicorns, imagine what a doctor could build for healthcare, or a teacher for education."

Hakivo launches publicly January 1, 2025, at hakivo.com. But the real launch is of a new era—where anyone with an idea and $20/month can build software that previously required millions in venture capital.

**For Interview Requests:**
Moody offers to build new features live during interviews, demonstrating real-time AI-assisted development. Contact tarik@hakivo.com to schedule.

**About Tarik Moody**
Tarik Moody is Director of Strategy and Innovation at 88Nine Radio Milwaukee (NPR), founding Program Director of HYFIN, host of the syndicated Rhythm Lab Radio for over 20 years, and founder of Hakivo. A Howard University graduate and former architect, he has become a pioneer in AI-assisted software development, proving that non-technical founders can build enterprise-grade applications using conversational AI.

## Press Release #3: David vs. Goliath/Bootstrap Angle

### EMBARGOED UNTIL [DATE] AT 12:01 AM ET

**From Architecture to Radio to AI: Howard Grad Takes on $230M-Funded GovTech Giants—No VCs, No Engineers, No Problem**

*88Nine's Director of Strategy and Innovation Bootstraps Competitor to FiscalNote Using Claude AI as Sole Developer*

**MILWAUKEE, WI** – In an industry where FiscalNote has raised $230 million and employs 500+ people, a media executive with an architecture degree is proving that AI has fundamentally broken the venture capital model. Tarik Moody, Director of Strategy and Innovation at 88Nine Radio Milwaukee (NPR), has built Hakivo—a legislative intelligence platform that matches features of companies valued at hundreds of millions—with just $10,000 and conversations with AI.

"My competitors have Harvard MBAs, Sand Hill Road connections, and engineering teams from Google," said Moody. "I have a microphone, a Macbook, and Claude AI. Guess who's shipping faster?"

The contrast is stark:

**FiscalNote:**
- Funding: $230 million
- Employees: 500+
- Time to market: 7 years to profitability
- Monthly burn: $3-5 million
- Customers: 5,000 organizations

**Hakivo:**
- Funding: $10,000 (personal savings)
- Employees: 0
- Time to market: 8 months
- Monthly burn: $300
- Potential: Unlimited with near-zero marginal cost

The platform offers comparable functionality: tracking legislation across all 50 states and Congress, AI-powered bill analysis, personalized alerts, and—unique to Hakivo—audio briefings that leverage Moody's radio expertise.

"VCs always ask about defensibility and moats," Moody explains, drawing on his experience building HYFIN and hosting Rhythm Lab Radio for two decades. "My moat is that I don't need them. While competitors burn millions to maybe break even, I'm profitable at 100 users. My architecture training taught me to design with constraints—AI just gave me unlimited materials."

The development process defies Silicon Valley orthodoxy:
- No technical co-founder search (6 months saved)
- No equity negotiations (25% of company saved)
- No hiring delays (3 months saved)
- No technical debt (built with latest best practices)
- No office lease (100% remote from day one)

Industry veterans are stunned. "This shouldn't be possible," admitted a former FiscalNote executive who requested anonymity. "We had entire teams doing what he's doing alone with AI. It's like watching someone win Formula 1 in a Tesla they built in their garage."

Moody's approach challenges every assumption about software startups:
1. **You need technical co-founders** (False: AI is the co-founder)
2. **You need venture capital** (False: $300/month is sustainable)
3. **You need a team** (False: AI scales infinitely)
4. **You need an office** (False: Built from a radio station)
5. **You need to quit your day job** (False: Nights and weekends work)

"The irony is that I could raise funding now, but why would I?" Moody asks. "Dilute myself to scale something that already scales infinitely? The VC model assumes scarcity of technical talent. AI eliminated that scarcity."

Hakivo's January 1 launch represents more than a new product—it's a proof point that the traditional startup playbook is obsolete. When non-technical founders can build faster and cheaper than funded teams, what happens to the $500 billion venture capital industry?

**Live Demo Available:**
Moody will build custom features during interviews to demonstrate AI-assisted development in real-time. "Give me a feature request. In 10 minutes, it'll be live. That's the power of this approach."

## Press Release #4: Exclusive for TechCrunch

### EXCLUSIVE: UNDER EMBARGO UNTIL [TECHCRUNCH PUBLISH DATE]

**First Look: NPR Executive and Former Architect's AI-Built SaaS Reaches Feature Parity with $230M Competitor in 8 Months**

*88Nine Milwaukee's Director of Strategy and Innovation Demonstrates New Development Paradigm Where English Replaces Code*

**MILWAUKEE, WI** – TechCrunch has learned exclusively that Tarik Moody, Director of Strategy and Innovation at Milwaukee's 88Nine Radio (NPR) and Howard University architecture graduate who has never written code, has built a government technology platform that directly competes with FiscalNote's core offerings using only Claude AI as his development team.

In a live demonstration for TechCrunch, Moody built and deployed new features in real-time, showing how natural language prompts translate into production-ready code. The session revealed a development velocity that challenges industry assumptions about team size and burn rates.

"Watch this," Moody said during our demo, typing a plain English description of a complex feature. Within minutes, Claude had generated the backend logic, frontend components, database migrations, and tests. "I just did in 5 minutes what would take a sprint planning meeting just to discuss at most startups."

Key Technical Achievements:
- **50,000+ lines of code** across TypeScript, React, and Python
- **Real-time data pipeline** processing 100,000+ bills
- **Audio generation system** using Gemini TTS
- **Multi-tenant architecture** supporting B2B and B2C models
- **90% automated test coverage**
- **Zero security vulnerabilities** (AI doesn't make OWASP mistakes)

The platform runs on modern infrastructure that would make any CTO jealous:
- Cloudflare Workers for edge computing
- Supabase for real-time database
- Vector embeddings for semantic search
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- Comprehensive monitoring and alerting

"This isn't a prototype or MVP," emphasizes Moody. "This is production-ready infrastructure that serves real users every day. The only difference is I didn't type any of it."

The disruption potential is massive. YC partner [NAME] (who requested anonymity) told TechCrunch: "If this scales, it breaks our entire investment thesis. Why fund technical teams when domain experts can build better products faster with AI?"

During our interview, Moody received a feature request from a user. He implemented it while we talked. "My architecture training taught me to visualize complete systems before building," he explained, referencing his Howard University degree and early career. "My 20 years in radio taught me to communicate complex ideas simply. AI development combines both—I visualize the system, describe it clearly, and AI builds it perfectly."

The numbers tell the story:
- **Customer acquisition cost:** $0 (organic from story)
- **Development cost:** $10,000 total
- **Time to revenue:** 8 months
- **Break-even point:** 100 users
- **Total addressable market:** Same as FiscalNote's $5B

Moody plans to document his methodology in a series of workshops for non-technical founders. "Every industry expert trapped in a non-technical body can now build their vision. I'm just the first. There will be thousands."

When asked about competition from his well-funded rivals, Moody laughed. "They're playing a different game. They're optimizing for valuations and exit multiples. I'm optimizing for sustainable profit from day one. We're not even in the same race."

Hakivo launches January 1, 2025, but TechCrunch readers can access the beta immediately at hakivo.com/techcrunch.

**Note to editors:** Moody is available for podcast appearances and will demonstrate building features live on air. Contact directly at tarik@hakivo.com.

Subject: Story Tip: NPR Executive & Howard Architect Grad Builds $500K Software Platform Without Coding

Hi [Reporter],

Quick story that your readers need to know:

I'm Director of Strategy and Innovation at 88Nine Milwaukee (NPR). I also built a government tech platform that competes with companies worth hundreds of millions. I don't know how to code.

I used Claude AI as my CTO. 8 months, $10,000, zero employees.

The platform (hakivo.com) tracks every bill in America and explains them in plain English through daily podcasts. My competitors (FiscalNote, Quorum) have raised $300M+ combined.

Why this matters:
- Proves non-technical founders can build sophisticated software
- Demolishes the "technical co-founder needed" myth
- Shows AI replacing entire engineering teams, not just junior devs

I'll do something no other founder can: Build features live during our interview.

Want to see the future of software development?

Tarik
```

### For Business/Entrepreneur Press

```
Subject: Bootstrap Story: $300/Month Competing with $100M Revenue FiscalNote

[Reporter Name],

The venture capital model just broke, and I can prove it.

I'm competing with FiscalNote ($100M revenue, 500 employees) with:
- $300/month in costs
- Zero employees
- No coding background (but I can design systems - Howard architecture degree)
- AI as my only "developer"

Built Hakivo in 8 months using Claude AI to write 50,000+ lines of code. Now tracking legislation for all 50 states, generating AI analysis, and creating daily audio briefings.

The math that breaks VC:
- They need $3M/month burn → I need $300
- They need 18 months to ship → I shipped in 8
- They need 10 engineers → I need Claude
- They need $50K CAC → I get users from this story

Happy to share full P&L, development methodology, and build something live on our call.

This isn't the future. It's happening now.

## The Architecture Angle (Unique Hook)

### Why Architecture → AI Is The Perfect Path

**Pitch this angle hard - it's unique and compelling:**

"Architecture taught me to design systems before building them. At Howard, we learned to visualize complete structures, understand load-bearing requirements, and design with constraints. That's exactly what AI development requires—clear system visualization and precise communication of requirements.

Most developers think in code. I think in systems and blueprints. AI doesn't need someone who can code—it needs someone who can architect. My transition from designing buildings to designing HYFIN's sonic architecture to designing Hakivo's digital architecture is perfectly logical. The medium changed, but the design thinking remained."

**Key Quote:** "I went from AutoCAD to Audio to AI—each time, the tool changed but the architectural thinking stayed the same."

## Key Messages for All Press

## Final Notes

**Remember:** You're not pitching Hakivo. You're pitching the story of how a radio host made the impossible possible. Hakivo is proof, not product.

**The hook:** Live demonstration. No other founder can do this. Use it in every pitch.

**The angle:** You're a sitting NPR executive with an architecture degree who hosts a syndicated radio show. This isn't a quit-your-job story. It's a "renaissance professional builds the future" story.

**Your credibility stack:**
- Howard University (HBCU prestige)
- Architecture training (systems thinking)
- 20+ years radio (communication mastery)
- NPR executive (media innovation)
- HYFIN founder (proven builder)
- Rhythm Lab Radio (national reach)

**The urgency:** First-mover advantage on this narrative. Once it's out, everyone will try to replicate.

Make the story about the future, not the past. You're not telling what you did—you're showing what everyone will be doing.
